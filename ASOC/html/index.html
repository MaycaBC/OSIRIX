		<h1>ASOC plugin</h1>
  <div id="text">
	<p><span class="title">Description:</span> ASOC means "AppleScript Objective-C". This is a technology new in OS X 10.6, which integrates Applescript with Objective-C. Our ASOC plugin demonstrates this technology with a very simple example of communication between OsiriX and scriptable apps by means of applescript</p>
  	<p><span class="title">Usage:</span></p>
  	<p>This plugin only says "hello", writes the version of the Finder to the Console and says "you are a genius". Nothing really usefull. Except for developpers, who can modify a copy of it in order to improve the interaction of OsiriX with scriptable apps. You can look for more information within the README.txt file of the XCode project</p>
